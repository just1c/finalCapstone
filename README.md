# finalCapstone

## Description
I was assigned the task of refactoring and enhancing a straightforward command-line task manager. This tool allows users to create tasks, specifying deadlines, descriptions, and assigned users. Additionally, there exists an admin user role, which has the capability to generate statistics regarding the tasks and users saved within the system and automate the process of writing reports based on these statistics- user_overview.txt and task_overview.txt.
